## Intro

This is a running list of my favorite restaurants in and surrounding Boston with some brief commentary on what I like about them! The üî• emoji indicates it's a *favorite* favorite. The list is organized by neighborhood.

This is a work in progress, and someday I'll make it more readable/interactive.

## Cambridge

### [Little Donkey](http://www.littledonkeybos.com/)
Unique "global" tapas. There's something for everyone on the menu, from the raw bar to the burger. Ambiance and drinks are great, too. Get the cookie dough for dessert!

### [Felipe‚Äôs](https://www.felipesboston.com/) 
Affordable, fast casual Mexican place with a rooftop bar that's super fun in good weather. Yes, it's a Harvard/college-y spot, but I still love going here for a decent margarita (on the rocks ... with salt).

### [Mamaleh‚Äôs](http://mamalehs.com/)
Jewish deli, need I say more? Pastrami & egg sandwich for brekky is a crowd pleaser.

### [BISq](http://www.bisqcambridge.com/)
Awesome rotating wine list, and I believe the owner is a somellier. Simple menu that doesn‚Äôt disappoint. Nice atmosphere.

### [Source](https://sourcerestaurants.com/) üî•
**Incredible Neapolitan pizza**. Maybe that's in bold becuase I ate here two days prior to writing this, or maybe it's just awesome pizza. Order it NYC style to get it a little thinner! 
Great wine, beer, and cocktails. The inside is cozy with huge black-framed windows towards the back.

### [Puritan & Company](https://www.puritancambridge.com/)
Truly a dining experience. The menu is straight forward and every dish has unique flare. Had incredible Burratta with Zucchini Gazpacho, and a delicious steak. Great cocktail and wine menu, too.

## Somerville

### [Sarma](https://www.sarmarestaurant.com/) üî•
Incredible mediterranean tapas. My first visit was during COVID-19 with a fixed 10-course tasting menu, and I was stuffed. A few memorable plates were the gazpacho, chickpea fritters, and the sesame chicken skewers.

### [3 Little Figs](https://www.3littlefigs.com/)
One of the better bakeries/coffee shops I've been to in Boston. Amazing smoothies, coffee, pastries and sandwiches.

### [Bloc Cafe](https://blocsomerville.com/)
Yet another amazingly good coffee shop and it's fun to sit on their patio! Their smoothies are the best I've had in recent memory.

### [Bow Market](https://www.bowmarketsomerville.com/) üî•
Make a reservation ahead of time for outdoor seating! Walk-up drinks and food stands (Saus, Mike & Patty‚Äôs, Hotbox, and more). There are also some cool rotating pop-up shops and a wine store to check out. Remnant Brewing also has a ton of their own seating (and awesome beer).

### Leone's
Cash-only sicilian pizza and subs. Incredibly good takeout and a Somerville staple

![leones](/images/leones.jpeg)

### [Avenue Kitchen + Bar](https://www.avenuesomerville.com/)
Can't speak to their menu at large, however their Detroit-style pizza is crazy good. Certainly competes with Leone's.

## South End

### [MIDA](https://www.midaboston.com/) üî•
Modern Italian, great arancini. Make sure to ask for their bread. Lots of hygge. Best tiramisu I've ever had. One of my all-time favorites!

### [Barcelona](https://barcelonawinebar.com/location/south-end/) 
Awesome tapas and always great for brunch. Sure, it's a chain, but it never disappoints. Also lots of hygge.

### [The Beehive](https://www.beehiveboston.com/) 
Fun ambiance with a jazz band usually playing downstairs. Great food and unique cocktails.

### [Coppa](https://www.coppaboston.com/)
Popular modern Italian spot serving brick oven pizza and other small plates. This is a South End fan favorite. I've only been once on New Year's Eve, and I think the holiday affected our meal a bit. That said, it still deserves a spot on the list.

### [Five Horses Tavern](https://www.fivehorsestavern.com/boston/) 
Great rotating beer list, good for brunch and dinner, nice patio. Consistent "nic*er* bar food."

### [Area Four](https://www.areafour.com/) 
*Wicked* good pizza. Additional location in Kendall as well.

### [Mike & Patty‚Äôs (Bay Village)](https://www.mikeandpattys.com/)
Best breakfast sandwiches I've had in Boston! Tiny hole-in-the-wall type place, order ahead online or you'll be waiting a while. The Bow Market location is equally as good.

### [Burro Bar](https://www.burrobarboston.com/)
Really nice covered outdoor patio, and great atmosphere inside! On the Taco-meter (patent pending), their tacos exceed Loco's but aren't quite as good as the OG Yellow Door's in Dorchester.

## Southie/Dorchester

### [Publico](http://publicoboston.com/)
U-shaped bar and a half-outdoor patio. Really good food, arguably underrated.

### [Fox and the Knife](https://www.foxandtheknife.com/)
Opened in 2019 and named one of the best new restaurants in America by Eater National, Food & Wine, and USA Today. House made ricotta, house made pasta, great wine. Don't skip on the foccaccia and only 12 chocolate dipped pistachio ice cream sandwiches made per night! Chef Karen Akunowicz has earned multiple James Beard Awards.

### [The Galley](https://thegalleydiner.com/)
Authentic Southie breakfast, greasy diner food that cures a hangover. Visited by Anthony Bourdain.

### Lincoln/Capo/The Broadway 
One and the same: consistently solid food which is good for local takeout. My personal favorite is Lincoln‚Äôs Butternut Squash pizza. 

### Rondo‚Äôs 
Another Southie staple. No-frills sub shop visited by Anthony Bourdain. Used to be cash only until 2021.

### [American Provisions](https://www.americanprovisions.com/)
Local grocery store with great sandwiches, coffee (beverages to go and locally roasted beans), bread, wines/beers/pastas/sauces and some prepared meals. The owner recently opened a wine bar next door, Gray's Hall, that I've yet to try.

### [Moonshine 152](https://moonshine152.com/) 
Asian influenced brunch spot with Parks and Rec inspired offerings. Very eclectic, thoughtful dishes. Chef Asia Mei has an interesting background and is often roaming the restaurant!

### [Yellow Door Taqueria](https://www.yellowdoortaqueria.com/)
**Amazing** margaritas and tacos. Fun to eat at the bar. New location in the South End is good, but not quite as good as the original location in Dorchester. And yes, both locations have yellow doors.

## Back Bay

### [Lolita](https://www.lolitamexican.com/) 
Great upscale Mexican spot with awesome drinks. Street corn appetizer is amazing, and everyone loves the cotton candy you get at the end of the meal. Additional location in Fort Point, but I prefer Back Bay.

### [Buttermilk & Bourbon](https://www.buttermilkbourbon.com/)
Some of the best fried chicken and biscuits you can get! The french onion soup is also incredible.

### [Porto](https://www.porto-boston.com/)
In the heart of the city. Cool outside patio, good ‚ÄúMediterranean American‚Äù food. Not the absolute best food I've ever had, but the location is nice. 

## North End

### [Modern Pastry](https://www.modernpastry.com/)
Less of a tourist trap than Mike's, the cannolis won't dissappoint and are filled fresh on the spot.

### [Al Dente](http://www.aldenteboston.com/)
Your classic "hole in the wall" Italian joint. Homemade pasta is great!

### [Ernesto's](http://www.ernestosnorthend.com/)
Good casual pizza. Nothing fancy here.

### [Bova's Bakery](http://bovabakeryboston.net/) üî•
In my opinion, Bova's offers the best pastries in the North End. You'll walk in and *probably* want one of everything. Don't miss out on the rainbow cookies!

### Monica's
Delicious, fresh sandwiches. Prosciutto sliced right before your eyes.

![Monicas](/images/monicas.jpeg)

## Seaport

### [City Tap](https://www.citytap.com/location/fort-point/)
Great casual ambiance, nice patio, huge beer list, and an awesome burger. Get an egg on the burger!

### [Row 34](https://www.row34.com/) 
High end seafood, industrial vibes inside and a nice patio.

### [The Barking Crab](http://barkingcrab.com/)
Tent (heated in winter) on the channel. Fun spot for a beer after work.

### [Pastoral](https://pastoralfortpoint.com/) 
Good lunch spot for brick oven pizza and sandwiches! They keep it simple and their pizza is really good.

### [The Smoke Shop](https://thesmokeshopbbq.com/) 
Conveniently located, pretty good BBQ. Sauces are good, as are the platters with sides.

### [Trillium](https://www.trilliumbrewing.com/) üî•
**Great** local Boston beer, incredible NE IPAs, curated food menu, and a huge patio + roofdeck. Renowned beer.

### [Committee](https://committeeboston.com/)
Super good Mediterranean tapas. Sesame encrusted feta with greek honey and the zucchini crisps are üíØ.

### [Flour](https://flourbakery.com/)
Delicious sandwiches, soups, salads, and desserts/pastries. Perfect place to pickup lunch when you're in the office. I used to work down the street from the Seaport location and quickly became a regular.

## Brookline

### [La Morra](https://lamorra.com/)
Incredible Italian. My sister's all-time favorite Boston restaurant. Get the Arancini!

### [Zaftigs Delicatessen](http://www.zaftigs.com/)
Great Jewish deli for lunch or an easy dinner. 

## Financial District

### [Boston Chops](https://www.bostonchops.com/)
Known to be one of the best steakhouses in Boston with multiple locations. The Financial District location is, in my opinion, the best! Don't skip on the popovers.

## East Boston

### [Santarpio's](https://www.santarpiospizza.com/) üî•
A Boston staple for NY style pizza. Opened in 1903 as a bakery and turned to a pizza joint in 1933. No frills and still run by the Santarpio family! There's a charm to the simplicity; the menu does not span beyond pizza, lamb skewers, steak tips and sausage. I'm lucky to have some friends who recently moved to Eastie, so I'll be visiting Santarpio's more often.
