## Intro

This is a running list of my favorite restaurants in and surrounding Boston with some brief commentary on what I like about them! The ðŸ”¥ emoji indicates some of my absolute favorites. The list is organized by neighborhood.

This is a work in progress, and someday I'll make it more readable/interactive.

## Cambridge

### [Giulia](https://www.giuliarestaurant.com/) ðŸ”¥
All pasta is homemade, the cocktails are amazing, and the "sfizi" small plates are a great way to start off any meal. It can be tough to get a reservation, but if you're a small enough group and in the area, you could get a spot at the bar.

### [Little Donkey](http://www.littledonkeybos.com/)
Unique "global" tapas. There's something for everyone on the menu, from the raw bar to the burger. Ambiance and drinks are great, too. Get the cookie dough for dessert!

### [Oleana](https://www.oleanarestaurant.com/) ðŸ”¥
Turkish and Middle East small plates that are *amazing.* Can be tough to get a reservation and is well worth the wait!

### [Alden & Harlow](https://www.aldenharlow.com/)
Awesome small plates in Harvard Squareâ€“ great for brunch and dinner!

### [Mamalehâ€™s](http://mamalehs.com/)
Jewish deli, need I say more? Pastrami & egg sandwich for brekky is a crowd pleaser.

### [Source](https://sourcerestaurants.com/) ðŸ”¥
**Incredible Neapolitan pizza**. Order it NYC style to get it a little thinner! Great wine list, beer list, and cocktails. 

### [Si Cara](https://sicarapizza.com/)
A modern pizzabar in Central Square! Get the garlic bread, share some pizzas, drink wine, be merry.

### [Puritan & Company](https://www.puritancambridge.com/)
I feel like this restaurant deserves more hype. Only visited once, and had incredible Burratta with Zucchini Gazpacho and a delicious steak. Great cocktail and wine menu, too.

### [Area Four](https://www.areafour.com/) 
*Wicked* good pizza in Kendall. Good beer, too!

## Somerville

### [Sarma](https://www.sarmarestaurant.com/) ðŸ”¥
Incredible mediterranean tapas. My first visit was during COVID-19 with a fixed 10-course tasting menu, and I was stuffed. A few memorable plates were the gazpacho, chickpea fritters, and the sesame chicken skewers. I've been back a number of times since the fixed menu and it remains a favorite!

### [Celeste](https://celesteunionsquare.com/) ðŸ”¥
Epic Peruvian food in Union Square! Start off with a Pisco Sour (or two) and take it from there.

### [field & vine](https://www.fieldandvinesomerville.com/)
_Sheeeeesh!_ Tapas that rotate based on season. Everything's fresh, everything's local. Their staff loves food and *loves wine* which really amplifies the vibe.

### [June Bug](https://www.junebugrestaurant.com/) ðŸ”¥
This is field & vine's latest "project," also in Union Square and the wood-fired pizza is incredible! Similar to field & vine, the wine list is epic. 

### [Juliet](https://www.julietsomerville.com/)
*Awesome* french-inspired cuisine in Union Square in a cozy, recently expanded space. I've yet to try their brunch and lunch, and have always enjoyed their dinner (and wine list!).

### [Josephine](https://www.josephinepizza.com/)
Great pizza (deep dish and thin wood-fired!) from the same chef/restauranteur as Alden & Harlow! Good, modern, open-air vibe and a fun atmosphere for a casual bite.

### [Bow Market](https://www.bowmarketsomerville.com/) 
There's something for everyone at Bow. Rotating pop-ups, Saus, Mike & Patty's, Hotbox, Remnant Brewing, Rebel Rebel (a natural wine bar that routinely [receives high praise](https://www.rebelrebelsomerville.com/press)). Head here for some shopping, a casual dinner & drink on the patio, a glass of wine at Rebel Rebel, or a great NEIPA at Remnant.

### Leone's
Cash-only sicilian pizza and subs. My go-to takeout pizza joint.

## South End

### [MIDA](https://www.midaboston.com/)
Modern Italian, great arancini. Make sure to ask for their bread, and don't skip on the Tiramisu. Locations also in Newton and Eastie.

### [KAVA Neo-Taverna](https://kavaneotaverna.com/) ðŸ”¥
Incredible Greek tapas! They only take reservations a day in advance, so keep a close eye on Resy and plan accordingly.

### [Barcelona](https://barcelonawinebar.com/location/south-end/) 
Awesome tapas and always great for brunch. Sure, it's a chain, but it never misses. Additional locations in Brookline and Cambridge as well.

### [The Beehive](https://www.beehiveboston.com/) 
Fun ambiance with a jazz band usually playing downstairs. Great food and unique cocktails.

### [Coppa](https://www.coppaboston.com/)
Popular modern Italian spot serving brick oven pizza and other small plates. A South End fan favorite.

### [Five Horses Tavern](https://www.fivehorsestavern.com/boston/) 
Great rotating beer list, good for brunch and dinner, nice patio. Consistent "nic*er* bar food."

## Southie/Dorchester

### [Fox and the Knife](https://www.foxandtheknife.com/)
Opened in 2019 and named one of the best new restaurants in America by Eater National, Food & Wine, and USA Today. House made ricotta, house made pasta, great wine. Don't skip on the foccaccia and only 12 chocolate dipped pistachio ice cream sandwiches made per night! Chef Karen Akunowicz has earned multiple James Beard Awards.  

### [Bar Volpe](https://www.barvolpe.com/)
Chef Karen's at it again! Southern Italian flare (fish) and just down the road from Fox and the Knife. 

### [The Galley](https://thegalleydiner.com/)
Authentic Southie breakfast, greasy diner food that cures a hangover. It's a dive, and it's perfect. Visited by Anthony Bourdain.

### [Via Cannuccia](https://www.viacannuccia.com/)
A bakery, a trattoria, a pizzeriaâ€“ had a great dinner here and eager to go back. You can stop in on weekend mornigns for pastries, too!

### Rondoâ€™s 
Another Southie staple. No-frills sub shop visited by Anthony Bourdain.

### [American Provisions](https://www.americanprovisions.com/)
Local grocery store with great sandwiches, coffee (beverages to go and locally roasted beans), bread, wines/beers/pastas/sauces and some prepared meals. The owner recently opened a wine bar next door, Gray's Hall.

### [Moonshine 152](https://moonshine152.com/) 
Asian influenced brunch spot with Parks and Rec inspired offerings. Very eclectic, thoughtful dishes. Chef Asia Mei has an interesting background and is often roaming the restaurant!

### [Yellow Door Taqueria](https://www.yellowdoortaqueria.com/)
**Amazing** margaritas and tacos. Fun to eat at the bar. New location in the South End is good, but not quite as good as the original location in Dorchester. And yes, both locations have yellow doors.

## Back Bay

### [Buttermilk & Bourbon](https://www.buttermilkbourbon.com/)
Some of the best fried chicken and biscuits you can get! The french onion soup is also incredible.

### [Contessa](https://contessatrattoria.com/boston/)
Holy atmosphere. It's a dining experience to eat at Contessa. The drinks are amazing, the atmosphere is amazing, and the food is _just ok_.

### [Faccia a Faccia](https://facciaafacciaboston.com/)
Same restaurant group as Little Donkey and Coppa, Facca a Faccia _slaps_. Did not have a single bad plate here, the pasta is homemade, and the Caviar Mozzarella Sticks are, in my opinion, novel!

## Back Bay

### [Mooo....](https://mooorestaurant.com/)
Prime steak & fine wine. Treat yo self!

## North End

### [Al Dente](http://www.aldenteboston.com/)
Quintessential "hole in the wall" Italian joint if you're looking for classic, heavy Italian. Homemade pasta is great!

### [Ernesto's](http://www.ernestosnorthend.com/)
Good casual pizza. Nothing fancy here.

### [Bova's Bakery](http://bovabakeryboston.net/) ðŸ”¥
In my opinion, Bova's offers the best pastries in the North End. You'll walk in and *probably* want one of everything. Don't miss out on the rainbow cookies! Bova's claim to fame is that it's open 24/7.

### [Cafe Vittoria](https://www.caffevittoria.com/)
Cash only cafe that's a fun spot for a drink and dessert after dinner.

## Seaport

### [Row 34](https://www.row34.com/) 
High end seafood, industrial vibes inside and a nice patio.

### [Lolita](https://www.lolitamexican.com/) 
Great upscale Mexican spot with awesome drinks. Street corn appetizer is amazing, and everyone loves the cotton candy you get at the end of the meal.

### [The Barking Crab](http://barkingcrab.com/)
Tent (heated in winter) on the channel. Fun spot for a beer on a nice day.

### [Pastoral](https://pastoralfortpoint.com/) 
Good lunch spot for brick oven pizza and sandwiches! They keep it simple and their pizza is really good.

### [The Smoke Shop](https://thesmokeshopbbq.com/) 
Conveniently located, pretty good BBQ. Sauces are good, as are the platters with sides.

### [Trillium](https://www.trilliumbrewing.com/) ðŸ”¥
**Great** local Boston beer, incredible NE IPAs, curated food menu, and a huge patio + roofdeck. Renowned beer.

### [Committee](https://committeeboston.com/)
Super good Mediterranean tapas. Sesame encrusted feta with greek honey and the zucchini crisps are ðŸ’¯.

### [Flour](https://flourbakery.com/)
Delicious sandwiches, soups, salads, and desserts/pastries. Perfect place to pickup lunch when you're in the office. I used to work down the street from the Seaport location and quickly became a regular.

## Brookline

### [La Morra](https://lamorra.com/)
Incredible Italian. My sister's all-time favorite Boston restaurant. Get the Arancini!

### [Zaftigs Delicatessen](http://www.zaftigs.com/)
Great Jewish deli for lunch or an easy dinner. 

## Financial District

### [Boston Chops](https://www.bostonchops.com/)
Known to be one of the best steakhouses in Boston with multiple locations. The Financial District location is, in my opinion, the best! Don't skip on the popovers.

## East Boston

### [Santarpio's](https://www.santarpiospizza.com/) 
A Boston staple for NY style pizza. Opened in 1903 as a bakery and turned to a pizza joint in 1933. **No frills** (literally, none) and still run by the Santarpio family! There's a charm to the simplicity; the menu does not span beyond pizza, lamb skewers, steak tips and sausage.
