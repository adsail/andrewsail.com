### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Andrew Sail

I'm currently an Engineer at Spotify in the cloud/infrastructure space focusing on Observability and Reliability. 

In my free time I enjoy traveling, flying single engine aircraft, skiing, golfing, cooking and baking. I love to ski out west in the Winter and spend time on Cape Cod in the Summer.
