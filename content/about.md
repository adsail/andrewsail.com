### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Andrew Sail

I'm currently a Senior Engineer at Spotify in the Core Infrastructure space focusing on Observability and Monitoring. 

In my free time I enjoy traveling, skiing, golfing, cooking and baking. I love to ski out west in the Winter and spend time on Cape Cod in the Summer.
